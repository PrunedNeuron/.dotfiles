Hey!!

There's no need to apologize at all! I completely understand that life gets busy. Take your time, there's no rush.

Also, it's reassuring to know that we share some common experiences, I really appreciate you sharing that with me :).

I too struggle with making close friends by the way, and while it certainly feels lonely at times, I'm sure progress is inevitable if we keep trying. At least I hope so haha 😅

As for the weekend, I'm definitely excited to have some downtime after the exam. Speaking of which, the exam was unfortunately rather difficult, I think I'll have to take the second attempt in September, but I'm not too worried as I have around a month to prepare. I'm in the Computer Science Masters program at the University of Bonn.

What about you? Any fun things you're excited about for the weekend? I'd love to hear more about your hobbies or anything else you'd like to share! 😊

Do you have a favorite song of all time? I'd love to know 😁

Looking forward to chatting more whenever you're up for it, no hurry :). Have a fantastic day/evening! 😊
